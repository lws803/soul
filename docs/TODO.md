# TODO list

- draft docs in docusaurus maybe
- add logging on each request
- add announcements endpoint that will let platform owners/ super admins announce a **verified message**
- Store datetime in utc on the db and do the conversion when we get to the endpoint
- create a tiny user storage for metadata or achievement purposes within the user table
- remove some api definitions from user connections
- Add test to ensure that user can only perform actions within the specific platform and not other platforms
- allow folks to download their connections and data in one big json blob
- Deal with some TODOs leftover
