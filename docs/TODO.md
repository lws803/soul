# TODO list

- hide some endpoints from being exposed in dokku/ nestjs
- add funding button to the repository

- create documentation for this that's deployed to github pages, maybe start work on the live platform site as well
- validate all features of this backend service and see if there are any security flaws or unused endpoints
- Store datetime in utc on the db and do the conversion when we get to the endpoint
