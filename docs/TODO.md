# TODO list

- turn platforms into a fixture so its easier to use everywhere without having to declare one from scratch
- expand on the readme to include some troubleshooting tips, setup tips, etc
- add dockerfile to run and test soul
- draft docs in docusaurus maybe
- add logging on each request
- add announcements endpoint that will let platform owners/ super admins announce a **verified message**
- Store datetime in utc on the db and do the conversion when we get to the endpoint
- create a tiny user storage for metadata or achievement purposes within the user table
- remove some api definitions from user connections
- Add test to ensure that user can only perform actions within the specific platform and not other platforms
- Deal with some TODOs leftover
